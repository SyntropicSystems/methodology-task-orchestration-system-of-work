# Learning

## Purpose

The learning stage is where double-loop learning occurs - reflection on the **system of work** itself, not the technical work. This is where we capture meta-patterns about process effectiveness and execution quality.

## Entry Criteria

- Task integrated and released
- Technical knowledge captured
- All follow-up tasks created
- Task moved from integration with completion event in ledger

## Exit Criteria

- System-of-work review completed
- Learning document created (recommended, not enforced)
- Process improvement signals identified
- Task ready to move to archived
- Review logged in ledger

## Governance Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| README.md | This file - stage context and criteria |
| INDEX.md | Tracking tasks currently in learning |
| learning.workflow.md | Workflow definitions for this stage (WF7) |

## Philosophy

This stage embodies **double-loop learning**: not just "did we do the work correctly?" but "are we working correctly?"

### Separation of Concerns

- **Integration Stage**: Technical learning (architecture, patterns, implementation)
- **Learning Stage**: Process learning (workflows, execution, system effectiveness)

### Trust & Flexibility

- Creating learning document is **recommended**, not enforced
- Skipping is okay - trust agent judgment
- Document reasons when valuable - helps collective improvement
- All decisions logged for transparency and learning
